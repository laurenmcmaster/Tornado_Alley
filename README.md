# Tornado_Alley
This project investigates changing tornado patterns in the United States, focusing on variations in frequency, intensity (EF-Scale ratings), and seasonal occurrences.

In this project, I used data from the SPC Tornado Database to investigate these key questions: 

1. Is Tornado Alley shifting elsewhere
2. Is tornado intensity consistent over time?
3. Are there changes in seasonal tornado patterns?


# Findings
## Tornado Alley's geographic location is shifting to the Southeast US.

Tornadoes in regions outside of Tornado Alley are increasing at a faster rate than those inside Tornado Alley.

## There have been no significant changes in tornado intensity
