## Findings

In conclusion, the findings of my project shed light on important trends and shifts in tornado occurrences and intensity over each time period. My analysis revealed several significant insights:

1. **Geographical Shifts in Tornado Occurrences:**
    - A statistically significant shift in the geographical distribution of tornado occurrences was observed. Tornadoes have transitioned from being predominantly located in the Central United States (Tornado Alley) to spreading towards the Southeastern United States. This geographical shift may have implications for disaster preparedness, as regions historically less prone to tornadoes must become more vigilant.
2. **Consistency in Tornado Intensity:**
    - My analysis did not identify any statistically significant changes in tornado intensity. While occurrences have shifted geographically, I found no evidence of a widespread increase or decrease in the overall intensity of tornadoes.
3. **Changes in Seasonal Tornado Patterns:** 
    - My project's examination of seasonality revealed an interesting pattern. I noticed a significant increase in spring tornadoes, which corresponds with findings from previous studies. However, the data revealed an unexpected and statistically significant increase in winter tornadoes, which may indicate an evolving seasonal trend. These trends may underline the need for more research into winter tornadoes which are traditionally less common but may be on the rise.

My findings provide insights into the importance of tracking shifts in both geographical and seasonal tornado patterns. As tornadoes continue to impact communities, understanding these trends is essential for enhancing disaster preparedness and safety measures.
