# Collecting the data

I used a dataset for this analysis, which I obtained from the [SPC Tornado Database](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data). Although a cleaned dataset with tornado data is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/us-tornado-dataset-1950-2021), the one I chose for this project contains more up-to-date information, so I decided to clean this dataset myself.

### Tornado dataset

- year
- month
- day
- date
- time
- state (state tornado originated in)
- f_rating (using the Fujita scale. Enhanced Fujita scale after January 2007. -9 for unknown)
- injuries
- fatalities
- starting_latitude
- starting_longitude
- ending_latitude
- ending_longitude
- length_mi (path in miles)
- width_yd (size in yards)
- num_states_affected
